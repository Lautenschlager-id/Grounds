# Grounds - # Transformice Lua API
This repository contains the source code for #Grounds.<br>
This module contains functions that are only available to Luacrew members. This means that the code in a tribe house won't work perfectly.

## What is Grounds?
Your aim in this minigame is to collect the cheese the faster you can, using the effects each ground offers.<br>
There are also submodes that you can play via the room attribute "Number\#ModeName", like "#grounds0\#xmas" to run #xmas.<br>
#Grounds is currently a semi-official minigame, i.e., it doesn't save data yet.
